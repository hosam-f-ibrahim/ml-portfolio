# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my journey into Machine Learning and AI.  
It contains notebooks, projects, and experiments that show my progress step by step.

## ðŸ“˜ Week 1 â€” Getting Started with Python
- **[hello_function_and_list.ipynb](hello_function_and_list.ipynb)**  
  A simple introductory notebook that demonstrates:
  - Printing a message
  - Defining and using a Python function
  - Transforming lists with list comprehension
  - Combining functions with transformations  

This notebook is my **first public milestone** in the ML journey â€” proving the workflow:
> *Write code â†’ Run â†’ Document â†’ Share (GitHub)*

## ðŸš€ Upcoming Weeks
- Week 2: Data analysis with pandas  
- Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project  
- Week 4â€“5: Core ML models (scikit-learn)  
- Week 6+: Deep Learning and LLM projects (Hugging Face, fast.ai)  

Stay tuned for more notebooks and projects as the journey continues!
